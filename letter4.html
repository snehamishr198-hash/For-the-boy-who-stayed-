  <h1>Letter Four</h1>

  <p>
    With you, I felt safe in ways I never had before.
    You listened to me, really listened,
    and for the first time I felt seen and heard.
    You made me feel like my words mattered,
    like my feelings were valid,
    and like I deserved to be treated gently and with respect.
    You gave me a kind of comfort I didn’t even know I needed.
