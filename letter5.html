  <h1>Letter Five</h1>

  <p>
    There was a time when I was at my lowest,
    when everything inside me felt heavy and broken.
    You had every reason to walk away,
    every reason to choose something easier.
    But you didn’t.
    You stayed when leaving would have been simpler,
    and that choice meant more to me than you’ll ever know.
