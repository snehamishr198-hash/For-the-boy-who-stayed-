  <h1>Letter Eleven</h1>

  <p>
    I don’t know what the future holds for us.
    I don’t know how time will change us,
    what life will ask of us,
    or how difficult some days might become.
    And sometimes that uncertainty scares me more than I admit.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are moments when I wonder
    if one day life will pull you in a direction
    where choosing me becomes hard.
    And if that day ever comes,
    I want you to know this truth without any pressure or blame —
    I will still choose you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not because it’s easy.
    Not because it doesn’t hurt.
    But because loving you was never a decision
    I made lightly or carelessly.
    It was something my heart chose
    long before my mind could keep up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even if loving you means loving you quietly,
    from a distance,
    or in ways that don’t always look perfect,
    my choice will remain the same.
    You will always be someone I choose,
    with honesty,
    with respect,
    and with love.
  </p>
