  <h1>Letter Nine</h1>

  <p>
    You are my everything, in ways I don’t always know how to explain.
    You are in my thoughts, in my prayers,
    in the quiet moments when I’m alone with myself.
    Loving you isn’t loud for me,
    it’s deep, constant, and real.
  </p>

  <p>
    I want you to grow, to become everything you dream of becoming.
    I want life to be kind to you,
    to give you success, peace, and happiness,
    even if someday that growth takes you far ahead of me.
    I never want to be the reason you stop becoming more.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes it hurts that I can’t give you much right now.
    I don’t have money, stability, or things to offer.
    All I have is my heart,
    my loyalty,
    and a love that chooses you every single day.
    And I hope that is enough, even on the days I feel small.
  </p>

  <p>
    No matter where life takes us,
    no matter how things change,
    I want you to know this:
    I am here.
    I will always be here.
  
    Choosing you,
    believing in you,
    loving you —
    even when it’s hard,
    even when it hurts,
    even when it’s quiet.
  </p>
