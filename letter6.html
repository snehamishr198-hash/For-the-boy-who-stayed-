  <h1>Letter Six</h1>

  <p>
    Sometimes I still wonder why you chose me.
    When you had the whole sea in front of you,
    people who could give you more,
    support you better,
    and offer things I couldn’t.
    I felt like I had nothing to give you,
    and yet you still chose me.
    In that choice, I saw the kind of person you truly are,
    and it made me love you even more.
