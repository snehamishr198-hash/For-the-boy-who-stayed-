  <h1>Letter Ten</h1>

  <p>
    Loving you didn’t just make me feel loved,
    it changed the way I see myself.
    Before you, I questioned my worth constantly.
    I wondered if I was too much,
    or not enough,
    or simply easy to leave.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the way you cared,
    the way you stayed,
    the way you chose to understand me instead of judging me,
    slowly rewired something inside my heart.
    You made me feel like I wasn’t asking for too much,
    like I was simply asking the right person.
  </p>

  <p>
    You didn’t save me in a dramatic way.
    You saved me quietly —
    by listening,
    by checking on me,
    by making space for my emotions,
    even when they were heavy.
    And that kind of presence changed me forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t know if I say this enough,
    but I see you.
    I see your patience,
    your strength,
    your softness that you don’t show the world easily.
    And I feel grateful every day
    that I get to love someone like you.
