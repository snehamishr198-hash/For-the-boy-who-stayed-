  <p>
    There was a moment when I truly felt like I had lost everything.
    You weren’t there for a while,
    and in that silence, I really did lose myself.
    I was barely breathing, barely holding on.
    And then you came back.
    You chose to stay,
    and somehow, you gave life back to me.
    You became the reason I could breathe again.
