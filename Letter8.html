  <h1>Letter Eight</h1>

  <p>
    Sometimes I think about the future
    and how life can change in ways we don’t expect.
    And even if one day you can’t choose me,
    I want you to know that I will still choose you.
    Every single day.
    Even if it hurts,
    even if it’s quiet,
    my choice will always be you.
