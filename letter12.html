  <h1>Letter Twelve</h1>

  <p>
    If this is the last letter you ever read from me,
    I want it to hold everything I couldn’t always say out loud.
    I want you to know that loving you
    has been one of the purest things I have ever felt.
    It wasn’t perfect,
    it wasn’t easy,
    but it was real —
    and that will always matter to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for choosing me when I felt unlovable.
    Thank you for staying when leaving would have been simpler.
    Thank you for seeing me
    not as someone broken,
    but as someone worthy of care and patience.
    You gave me memories,
    strength,
    and a version of myself I didn’t know existed.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t know where life will take us from here.
    I don’t know if our paths will always run side by side.
    But I do know this —
    I will never regret loving you.
    I will never regret choosing you,
    even on the days it hurt,
    even on the days I had nothing to give.
  </p>

  <p>
    My promise to you is simple and honest.
    I will never hold you back.
    I will never ask you to be less
    so I can feel more secure.
    I want you to grow,
    to chase your dreams,
    to become everything you’re meant to be —
    even if that journey takes you places
    where I can only cheer for you from afar.
  </p>

  <p>
    And no matter what happens,
    you will always be someone I loved deeply,
    gently,
    and truthfully.
    This love will never come with regret,
    only gratitude.
  </p>
