  <h1>Letter Three</h1>

  <p>
    Somewhere along the way, I realised you weren’t just
    someone I talked to anymore.
    You became the person my days felt incomplete without.
    The one I wanted to tell everything to,
    the one whose presence made ordinary moments feel lighter.
    That’s when I knew — you had quietly become special to me.
