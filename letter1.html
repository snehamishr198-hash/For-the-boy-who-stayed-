  <p>
    I still remember how we met on Snapchat — so randomly,
    yet it felt like fate had a quiet plan.
    From the very first conversation, something just clicked.
    I didn’t even realise when I started falling,
    but I fell deep.
    You were the first person to touch my heart
    in a way no one ever had before.
